# GROUP 1 DTP-DDW PROJECT SHOWCASE WEBSITE



## Inspirations

The user-interface of the site is inspired by modern UI elements such as gradients and parallax effects which are prevalently employed in many modern websites. In order to create a site with limited time despite the design aims that we want to achieve, we have chosen to use React JS as our web compilation library due to the aspect of modularity that it provides in the web-design process.

### Launching the web-app

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode from the root folder.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Notes of caution

Due to the site being in a development phase, there exists a bug where when the site is refreshed while the scroll bar is not on the first page of the site, the elements tied to the parallax effect of the site have a tendency to malfunction. To prevent or fix this, the site has to be refreshed from its landing page or a new instance of the site has to be launched.
